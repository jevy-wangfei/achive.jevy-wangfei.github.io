<p>I planed to buy a old style cell phone for my grandpa, but finally I buy a smart phone (based on Android) because it is so cheap that I can't reject it. </p>
<p>But I am in problems after giving the phone to my grandpa. He even don't know how to slide and touch the screan.</p>
<p>After showing him about the how to dial a number and recept a phone severial times, he gradually understands how to let the phone work.
However, he can't operate the phone smoothly and can't handle the applications besides the basic function of the phone -- calling. </p>
<p>On other sides, this phennomenon of the aged contacting the smart phone (based on Anfroid) at the first times is the same with children, even they could play with the smartphone after touch the screan serverial times. 
They don't know how to operation the smart phone by sliding and touching at first. They have no idear about the exceptions which always happend on Android system based smartphone. </p>
<p>But there is an exception. Children can operation the iPhone smoothly because they know to press the big "HOME" button to go back the home page.
Could the aged can operation the iPhone smoothly?</p>
