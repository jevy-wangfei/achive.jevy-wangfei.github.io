We get two restaurants' support who will provide us their materials of restaurants and dishes. And they are glade to participate our project to contributes ideas of packaging and delivery.
With restaurants's help, Yiyuan Zhou and Hongyu Gao will work on improving business plan to make it mature enough to get cooperation with more restaurant and third parties.
Danyang Li builts a RESFful service prototype based on spring boot.
I create a UI prototype design.

Research on distributed images storage and retrieve using javascript and static html from RESTful service. And implement a prototype using code.

There is a technology issues that we should consider now to make the system flexible enough to support larg scale of pictures. The solution we got is:
1. save images on other machine/directory which is independent to current server.
2. save a URL and compiled unique name of image to database.
3. explorer will retrieve image using the URL and name using RESTful image api which provided by image hosted server.
