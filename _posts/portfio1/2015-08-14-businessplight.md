We take the first tutor meeting this Monday. The meeting exposes our problems in doing project and leads us to focus on market. The four concepts proposed by Dr. Flint are key factors guiding us to success:

1. A software should be valuable for some people or public. On other hand, market means people requirements from which people can get benefit, save time or money, or get convenient. Market is essential for a project, because the goal of software is to create value to those people. When we launch a project, we must estimate its value firstly. Meanwhile, a successful project should create value for ourselves.
2. The functions of software should come from requirements. Project manager and project team should have a well defined requirements and study it carefully. If there is no such requirement(such as setup project), team should discuss or make survey with customers.
3. Project management is a tool to estimate and build confident of the project. In the "estimate--plan--execute-re-estimate" loop, project management tool helps project manager to estimate current situation, improve project plan and finally improve the confident of the project. Remember, all what we do on project management is to make us more confident for the project. Documents in project management is to help us to finished project, it can't be a burden. For small project, document is not necessary.
4.Correctly estimate team members' ability and allocate work. Market focused IT project includes kinds of technic and non-technic works. Right people doing right work keeps every one participated in the project and contributes their ability to intelligence.

Review the four key factors, I and partners find some deficiencies. The Telecom Business Intelligence project focuses on telecom data analysis. Because of confidential and less of cooperation with telecom companies, we can't get customers' requirements. Also, the industry this project focused is unfamiliar for my partners. They don't understand how the raw data is generated, what to do that data format and what customers want from our system. It is knowledge and technology constrains. Besides, the project focuses on technologies too much that two of my partners may not participate in this project in deep because they are not good at programming. I greatly understand the shortage of human resources, telecom knowledge and technology resources.

Meanwhile, Danyang Li, Yiyuan Zhou and I are considering to setup a online food booking and delivery system as innovation project on summary vacation. Why not try it now? We have enough technology guys to programing the system. And the two partners can contribute their effort and intelligence on market. It is what they good at.
