My name is Fei Wang. I graduated from Hefei University of Technology (one national key university of China) in 2010. In the past three years, I worked in the global technology service department of ZTE co., LTD. 

I am very interested in large scale data process and familiar with some excellent large-scale data process solutions such as hadoop and NoSQL. I want to make an in-deep research on it. In order to further improve my professional capabilities, I plan to go abroad for further study.
