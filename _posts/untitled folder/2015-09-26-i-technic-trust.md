Today I ready the report from Baidu News that American technology giant IBM will allow Chinese government access its software codes. Chinese government officials will be able to check the codes in the cleanroom to make sure they conform to Chinese national information security policies.

As a technical person in this industry, I quite understand it is a hard decision for IBM. For getting an entry into the billion-dollar government procurement market in China, this company had to make such a move.  It also shows that IBM is under pressure to sustain it business growth in China.

Actually, in resent years, oversee tech majors are facing huge trust crisis of Internet security in China.  

Stem from national security consideration, Chinese government has already begin to control the procurement of network products from foreign company, which means almost all of these world-renowned tech companies has to find their way to re-gain the trust of Chinese government to avoid being kick out from this billion-dollar market.

I think these foreign tech companies should try to build partnerships with local firms and transfer technologies to Chinese companies in order to gain long-term growth in China. IBM has already been moving in that direction, which means it can maintain its market in China better than its competitors.
