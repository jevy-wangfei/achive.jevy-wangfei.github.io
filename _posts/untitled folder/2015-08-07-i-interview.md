Through email is not the most efficient communication way, it is the most popular way to communicate in people.  Ten The interview is often the most daunting part of the English communication for many international students who come from non- English speaking country.

Ironically, most of them perform poorly in the speaking section in the interview because they over-prepare for it. The “error-free” templates and picture-perfect “model answers” committed to memory make the entire preparation process a strategic failure. From my perspective, the interviewer does not only just wants to get a “correct answer” but also intend to examine the interviewer’s English proficiency.

Personal preferences may vary when it comes to words, pronunciation and expression, bull all interviewers value spontaneity. It  is fairly easy for them to spot thoughtless spouting of prepared answers, because there are few or no nature pauses in answers given by rote. In addition, candidates tend to hesitate noticeably when the interviewers ask for further elaboration on a prepared response. This dramatic hesitation seriously erodes the candidate’s credibility in proving English proficiency, which often results in a bad impression.
 
As an international student from a non-English-speaking country, I am confident of my technical skills in my procession.  However, the ability of English communication is the passport to get a job in an English-speaking country. Language ability cannot be achieved overnight. It needs time and energy.

It is true that speaking a second language is partly a talent, but it is mostly a skill. I believe it will, like any other sill, improve with practical guidance and continued practice.
