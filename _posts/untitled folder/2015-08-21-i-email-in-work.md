Through email is not the most efficient communication way, it is the most popular way to communicate in people.  Ten millions emails fly over sky, transfer through ocean, or rush in the cables to go to their destination everyday.

I believe it is the  cheapest way to delivery a message to a mount of people. Comparing to mobile communication, replies of email require patient of initiator. It may need minutes, hours, days, or it never get reply. However, I like  to write a email or reply a email comparing to telecom call. The waiting time allow me to organize my mind entiely before write it down. <br/>

By the way, my email address is jevy.wangfei@gmail.com.
