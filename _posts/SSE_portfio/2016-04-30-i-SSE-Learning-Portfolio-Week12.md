Product standards
Looking through your home, almost every product is mad under specific standard. For example, electrical adapters,   size of beds, size of clothes, desktop, laptop, cell phone, etc. Life with kinds of product standards is much easier than without them. Considering travelling to foreign countries,  one thing you have to do before setting out is to check what kinds of electrical adapter is required for the country of destination. The product standards make everything pluggable for its relations. Such as all CD have 80 minutes long which allows all CD player can play the standard CD. 

Process standards
In IT work, the process standards are critical. For example, without the Internet protocol stack, the world can't fully connected, people can not enjoy the online multi-media, and a lot of new technology can not developed such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, and Intelligence City, etc.  The process standard defines how things are composed. 

System Standards
I worked as internship in a factory years ago. The experience told me how important the Safe management system is in a factory. As we know, there are kinds of machines and producing materials in a manufacture factory. The running machines and toxic materials are danger to workers. The standard of how to manage these things make the safety learnable for factory workers. Such as 4S standard which defines how to organize things through out a factory. Taking running machine for example, the standard defines how far away to the machine by bright yellow line on the ground.   

Well, when we look through a stands, it seams quite simple. However, the standard define may spend around ten years from idea, draft, to publish. Because the final released standard should be highest quality. Take USB Type-C connecter for example, it is finalized in August 2014 and currently used on MacBook, Chromebook Pixel, and ASUS Transformer book. It can be used as both electrical cable and USB connector. However, considering the usage of laptop that most of time the electrical cable should be connected, users have to remove the electrical cable first to make USB storage device connection available. It may make the device looks more beautiful, but add troubles for usage. Also, the standard is quite new, and many old devices may not adapter to this standard. So devices, such as in the bellowing picture, are invented. Quite strange phenomenon.

Currently, our team are developing the web client application for online booking system. Because of HTML standard implementation differential between explorers such as Safari, Chrome, FireFox and IE etc., we have to use third party HTML and CSS tool such as Bootstrap developed by Tweeter to solve this issue. It may because of commercial, market or company strategy, the products which unfollow/break the HTML standard have greatly effect IT industry and  have cost huge money and IT engineers' effort to solve the gape.  Good news is that the standard breakers are being driven away. 

Also, model driven software development is also facing standardization issues.   An unit defined standard on model driven software development could highly promote the broad usage of this software development method.
