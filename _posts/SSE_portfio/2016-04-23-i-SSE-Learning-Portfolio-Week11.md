Human error is inevitable. Engineers should keep this words in mind when they design system. Taking lecture case for example, engineers had done a lot on the security of airplane such as: two pilots flying, separate flying room to passengers' room, flying room door can only opened inside, complex warning system when airplane unstable. However, when the situation of one pilot leave flying room, the flying room door closed, and the pilot (who is sick)  depression showing effect,  the airplane is in danger. Just as the following picture shows that though engineers set a lot of dampers besides cause and accident, the event also may happen when it goes through the dampers' bug hole.

However, human error can be predicted by analyzing and reduced by setting fences around dangerous operations. For example, from accident engineer can identify hazards which involved in the event, use fault tree to analysis the minimal hazard sets which may cause the event, and then make standard safe checking list to identify potential risks. Since human is the last fence to ensure the safe, training, work regulation and processing standardization are extremely important to prevent human error cased accident. 

Different with human imagination, the connection between accident and its causes is not linear. It make the defense to human error caused accident more difficult. For large and complex system, a safety management system could be adopted to improve system safety. As we know, most accidents are caused by a series of human errors and they may happen after a long period.  The human errors must interactive with the system to change the status of the system, and finally cause the accident. So, the Safety Management System: 1. continuous monitoring the safety performance, 2. periodic review internal Safety Management System, and 3. accident investigation and cause analysis.
