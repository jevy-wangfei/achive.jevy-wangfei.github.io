There are two problem raised by Dr. Flint that we should take care after tutor meeting.

Firstly, there should be a well defined plan for the whole project which estimates the confident of the project. For example, this project have constrains such as time, technologies, human resources, marketing. We can make project plan after understanding those constrains. The plan may change when we really work on the project for a while. The re-estimate step will help us improve the plan, and make us have more confident for the project.
Secondly, system design should start from class diagrams other than tables relations of database. A well designed a system can greatly save people time when implement it.
