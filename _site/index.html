										<p>Back Door!!! How to check whether there are back doors in software? Code Review? It's Technic Trust issue, and it will become a obstruction of technic development.</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Today I ready the report from Baidu News that American technology giant IBM will allow Chinese government access its software codes. Chinese government officials will be able to check the codes in the cleanroom to make sure they conform to Chinese national information security policies.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.v3.co.uk/IMG/275/167275/padlock-security-protection-hacking-540x334.jpg?1384243708" /></p>

<p>As a technical person in this industry, I quite understand it is a hard decision for IBM. For getting an entry into the billion-dollar government procurement market in China, this company had to make such a move.  It also shows that IBM is under pressure to sustain it business growth in China.</p>

<p>Actually, in resent years, oversee tech majors are facing huge trust crisis of Internet security in China.</p>

<p>Stem from national security consideration, Chinese government has already begin to control the procurement of network products from foreign company, which means almost all of these world-renowned tech companies has to find their way to re-gain the trust of Chinese government to avoid being kick out from this billion-dollar market.</p>

<p><img src="http://malay.cri.cn/mmsource/images/2013/08/08/sinuodeng2.jpg" /></p>

<p>I think these foreign tech companies should try to build partnerships with local firms and transfer technologies to Chinese companies in order to gain long-term growth in China. IBM has already been moving in that direction, which means it can maintain its market in China better than its competitors.</p>

									<p>I belive that we forgot something after learning from other teams’ representations of the drone delivery system project.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/07/drone_main-100362463-primary.idge.jpg" /></p>

<p>Firstly, a project should have a target which is customers’ requirements. The target leads us to work for it. the target constrained by its scope, which tell us what should be done and what should no be considered. In this project, we forget its scope and add more and more functions, which are unnecessary and miss leading us to wrong direction.</p>

<p>However, with these function added, the project becomes especially difficult to implement in practice. Most functions are out of imagination and can only exist on paper. This is the project manager’s responsibility, who does not make good decision, not control the increasing of functions, and miss the project’s scope. As a monitor and evaluator, I have the responsibility to find problem from the evaluation and give advice to project manager. But I am not find the problem, or I don’t have opportunity to discuss and give advice. There are several reasons for the problems.</p>

<p><img src="http://disruptiveviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Dollarphotoclub_60017294_drones.jpg" /></p>

<p>Secondly, culture gape and understanding of language. People with different culture will focus on different parts of project. Such as some people prefer to think solution in overall aspects, while others will focus on a point and go further about this point. Project worked in this way may not well connected between each topic. Secondly, there is not enough meetings. Because it is difficult to find available time when all of people is free, some people may not participate in the meeting, and their parts are not well discussed. More importantly, individual’s work may not go in right direction if we do not work together for a long time slot. Working together in a place may greatly improve team work.</p>

<p>Thirdly, not just follow, participate in team work by giving your ideas and opinions. Creative works and results of team project come from team members contributes. Idea and knowledge collision inspire new idea and knowledge. Besides, feed backs from team members can improve your productivity. These problems have to be overcome in next project.</p>

										<p>Slow to deliver? Spam mails? But I LOVE using email</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Through email is not the most efficient communication way, it is the most popular way to communicate in people.  Ten millions emails fly over sky, transfer through ocean, or rush in the cables to go to their destination everyday.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/1293058386526163783.jpg" /></p>

<p>I believe it is the  cheapest way to delivery a message to a mount of people. Comparing to mobile communication, replies of email require patient of initiator. It may need minutes, hours, days, or it never get reply. However, I like  to write a email or reply a email comparing to telecom call. The waiting time allow me to organize my mind entiely before write it down. <br /></p>

<p>By the way, my email address is jevy.wangfei@gmail.com.</p>

<p>We take the first tutor meeting this Monday about COMP8600 Project (Telecom Business intelligence). The meeting exposes our problems in doing project and leads us to focus on market. The four concepts proposed by Dr. Flint are key factors guiding us to success:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A software should be valuable for some people or public. On other hand, market means people requirements from which people can get benefit, save time or money, or get convenient. Market is essential for a project, because the goal of software is to create value to those people. When we launch a project, we must estimate its value firstly. Meanwhile, a successful project should create value for ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of software should come from requirements. Project manager and project team should have a well defined requirements and study it carefully. If there is no such requirement(such as setup project), team should discuss or make survey with customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Project management is a tool to estimate and build confident of the project. In the “estimate–plan–execute-re-estimate” loop, project management tool helps project manager to estimate current situation, improve project plan and finally improve the confident of the project. Remember, all what we do on project management is to make us more confident for the project. Documents in project management is to help us to finished project, it can’t be a burden. For small project, document is not necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Correctly estimate team members’ ability and allocate work. Market focused IT project includes kinds of technic and non-technic works. Right people doing right work keeps every one participated in the project and contributes their ability to intelligence.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://snespecialprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/iStock_000027197562Medium-1789x640.jpg" /></p>

<p>Review the four key factors, I and partners find some deficiencies. The Telecom Business Intelligence project focuses on telecom data analysis. Because of confidential and less of cooperation with telecom companies, we can’t get customers’ requirements. Also, the industry this project focused is unfamiliar for my partners. They don’t understand how the raw data is generated, what to do that data format and what customers want from our system. It is knowledge and technology constrains. Besides, the project focuses on technologies too much that two of my partners may not participate in this project in deep because they are not good at programming. I greatly understand the shortage of human resources, telecom knowledge and technology resources.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Danyang Li, Yiyuan Zhou and I are considering to setup a online food booking and delivery system as innovation project on summary vacation. Why not try it now? We have enough technology guys to programing the system. And the two partners can contribute their effort and intelligence on market. It is what they good at.</p>

										<p>Perform your real characters to interviewer, don't copy answers from templates.</p>
									</blockquote>
									<p>Through email is not the most efficient communication way, it is the most popular way to communicate in people.  Ten The interview is often the most daunting part of the English communication for many international students who come from non- English speaking country.</p>

<p><img src="http://wireless-buzzers-quiz-buzzer-trivia-games.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Interview-trivia-playersjpg.jpg" /></p>

<p>Ironically, most of them perform poorly in the speaking section in the interview because they over-prepare for it. The “error-free” templates and picture-perfect “model answers” committed to memory make the entire preparation process a strategic failure. From my perspective, the interviewer does not only just wants to get a “correct answer” but also intend to examine the interviewer’s English proficiency.</p>

<p><img src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/steveodland/files/2012/03/recruiting-interview.jpg" /></p>

<p>Personal preferences may vary when it comes to words, pronunciation and expression, bull all interviewers value spontaneity. It  is fairly easy for them to spot thoughtless spouting of prepared answers, because there are few or no nature pauses in answers given by rote. In addition, candidates tend to hesitate noticeably when the interviewers ask for further elaboration on a prepared response. This dramatic hesitation seriously erodes the candidate’s credibility in proving English proficiency, which often results in a bad impression.
 
As an international student from a non-English-speaking country, I am confident of my technical skills in my procession.  However, the ability of English communication is the passport to get a job in an English-speaking country. Language ability cannot be achieved overnight. It needs time and energy.</p>

<p><img src="https://targetjobs.co.uk/sites/targetjobs.co.uk/files/public/last-minute-interview-confidence.png" /></p>

<p>It is true that speaking a second language is partly a talent, but it is mostly a skill. I believe it will, like any other sill, improve with practical guidance and continued practice.</p>

									<p>I planed to buy a old style cell phone for my grandpa, but finally I buy a smart phone (based on Android) because it is so cheap that I can't reject it. </p>
<p>But I am in problems after giving the phone to my grandpa. He even don't know how to slide and touch the screan.</p>
<p>After showing him about the how to dial a number and recept a phone severial times, he gradually understands how to let the phone work.
However, he can't operate the phone smoothly and can't handle the applications besides the basic function of the phone -- calling. </p>
<p>On other sides, this phennomenon of the aged contacting the smart phone (based on Anfroid) at the first times is the same with children, even they could play with the smartphone after touch the screan serverial times. 
They don't know how to operation the smart phone by sliding and touching at first. They have no idear about the exceptions which always happend on Android system based smartphone. </p>
<p>But there is an exception. Children can operation the iPhone smoothly because they know to press the big "HOME" button to go back the home page.
Could the aged can operation the iPhone smoothly?</p>
