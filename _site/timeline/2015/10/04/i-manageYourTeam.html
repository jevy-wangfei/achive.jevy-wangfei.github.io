　　　　<p>In the period of week 3 to week 7, we don’t really have a team leader because the changed project is easy and every one believes they understand their role.  Kate manage and follow each one’s work at the project meeting. However,  we got few achievement after four weeks. The feedme project goes in troubles. People do their work individually.  The components developed by us are totally not work when put them together. The plan has no detail and is not executable. Because of lacking experience, the project goes in troubles.</p>

<p>To make the project well planed and managed, I take the position of team leader to pull and push the project forward. The Trello helps me a lot to make and execute the plan. Following the system design, I decompose services into specific tasks with detail description. To let team member really understand their tasks, I keep talking them all the time.    And I demonstrate to my team member about how their tasks contribute to the whole project. That is really a tough work.</p>

<p>Moreover,  I have to think forward of the project and generate new tasks to assign them to team members. My routine job is to push every one work forward, pull their work to right direction, and adjust their work effort by estimating their work abilities.</p>

<p>This experience teaches me a lot on managing a team.  Especially, when the members of team comes from my classmate and they are weak on programing, database and Linux etc. skills.</p>
