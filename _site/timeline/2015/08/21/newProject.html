　　　　<p>We decided to do some research on the food booking and delivery project after team meeting. I and Jun chen create a customer survey sheet on google form. Danyang Li, Yiyuan Zhou and Hongyu Gao make plan of how and what to talking with manager of restaurants. The survey result is quit good. There are 24 for 30 customer want and like a better food delivery service. 20 of 25 restaurants like to participate this project. The restaurants who don’t have deliver team desire it to improve their business. From the survey, we found that what the customers really need is a good delivery services, and restaurants expect to attract more customer by providing take away and deliver services. But operate a deliver service (especially some small restaurants) spend much than what they can afford. Besides these valuable requirements, good parts of the project are that we can start the business and get revenue quickly, all partners can participate the project and contribute their ability to improve the business.</p>

<p>We create a business canvas to find what we can do for restaurants and public, what and how can we get from the project. We get permission from our tutor to change the Telecom Business Intelligence project to the Foodie project. Considering this is a totally business oriented project, we re-estimate partner’s abilities and make adjustment. Yiyuan Zhou focuses on market development and take the responsibility of managing the project. Danyang Li is still going to develop server of services. Jun Chen will focus on transaction of data from server to UI and iOS UI development. Hongyu Gao will work as administrator of the project to push our job and assistant Yiyuan Zhou to development market. I will work on system designing with Danyang Li, platform for the system, database, and web UI. Danyang Li and I also listen from Yiyuan Zhou for customer requirements to adjust the design of system.
