　　　　<p>I belive that we forgot something after learning from other teams’ representations of the drone delivery system project.</p>

<p>Firstly, a project should have a target which is customers’ requirements. The target leads us to work for it. the target constrained by its scope, which tell us what should be done and what should no be considered. In this project, we forget its scope and add more and more functions, which are unnecessary and miss leading us to wrong direction.</p>

<p>However, with these function added, the project becomes especially difficult to implement in practice. Most functions are out of imagination and can only exist on paper. This is the project manager’s responsibility, who does not make good decision, not control the increasing of functions, and miss the project’s scope. As a monitor and evaluator, I have the responsibility to find problem from the evaluation and give advice to project manager. But I am not find the problem, or I don’t have opportunity to discuss and give advice. There are several reasons for the problems.</p>

<p>Secondly, culture gape and understanding of language. People with different culture will focus on different parts of project. Such as some people prefer to think solution in overall aspects, while others will focus on a point and go further about this point. Project worked in this way may not well connected between each topic. Secondly, there is not enough meetings. Because it is difficult to find available time when all of people is free, some people may not participate in the meeting, and their parts are not well discussed. More importantly, individual’s work may not go in right direction if we do not work together for a long time slot. Working together in a place may greatly improve team work.</p>

<p>Thirdly, not just follow, participate in team work by giving your ideas and opinions. Creative works and results of team project come from team members contributes. Idea and knowledge collision inspire new idea and knowledge. Besides, feed backs from team members can improve your productivity. These problems have to be overcome in next project.</p>
