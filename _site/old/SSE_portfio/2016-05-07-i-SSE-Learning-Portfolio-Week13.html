　　　　<p>Currently, the software development process is following the steps of Requirements surveying, Software Designing(Modelling may included in the step), Coding and Delivery product. In most cases, the delivered project will run at maintenance status  to provide service to public customers or specific organizations. When there are new requirements coming from customers, people have to step through the development process again and again.  To shorter the software development duration and simplify the software development complexity, model driven software development was promoted. It uses model to represent requirements and display architecture or design. A model compiler translates the model to source code. Any issues discovered on test stage will directly feedback to original model. Modifications on the well organized and displayed model are as simple as drawing UML on UML tools. The modification will be compiled to source code as soon as finishing the model edition. Until recent years, the model driven software development have evolved. Taking SysML for example, it supports more features such as model analyzing to ensure model correct, model based testing to make code generation  transparent for terminate users, and requirements tracing to allow customer involved in the model design.</p>

<p>Model driven software development has so many good and useful features. However, very few of projects use it in practice. From figure “Primary Strategy for Modeling” we can find that projects in 40% just use model as tool to communicate or sketch thinking, another 40% project use model to sketch and capture key diagrams, and only less than 5% iterative projects really use model to generate code. It is reasonable that model is more commonly used in iterative lifecycle projects. But there is a question for agile, why agile software develop method do not use model driven? From this figure we also find that model driven software development only take very narrow range of the chart. Why?</p>

<p>I believe that this is related with  commercial factors: investment and revenue. As we know, human are the key participators, and human resource is the most expensive resource in software development. Since a few software engineers familiar with model driven software development, accepting this technic means large volume investment on human hours (their effort to do valuable work and their salary) and money (training, model complier, etc. ).  Comparing with model based software development, traditional code based projects can speed up their speed by hiring more software engineers, who are well trained at school. Also, globalization is another impact to model driven and it does good to traditional software development. Company can hire intelligent software engineers from China and Indian in lower price than Europe, America and Australia.</p>

<p>Another issue of model driven software development is standard. It is true that there are a lot of tools and their applying saturations. The number of model tools means no unit defined standard.  The following figure shows the chaos of model standards and their relationship. The chaos standards confuse people and stop them to study with interesting. If there is a well defined standard for model driven software development as simple as UML, software engineers and students would like to study it and apply it in their projects. At that time, the investment of applying model driven software development in commercial projects will decrease.</p>
