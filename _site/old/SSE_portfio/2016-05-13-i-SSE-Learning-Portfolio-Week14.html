　　　　<p>As IT engineers, we would like to work in engineering way. However, this is only one part of the whole commercialize project. From following chart we can learn that a commercial project includes: product management, partners, market, requirements, budget, profit, etc. All of these factors effect each others and finely contribute to project success or failure. Besides these factors, political, economic, sociological, technological, legal, environmental also should be considered when run commercial project.</p>

<p>In software development domain, it follows the process of requirement, designing, coding and testing. Some model based project also using model simulation to demonstrate designing correct. Issues found in testing will feedback to design to improve the designing. Also, we should remember that the requirements come from customers, and the requirements will change as their business going. So, suitable lifecycle chosen plays critical role in software development. If you are facing dynamic requirements circumstance, an agile lifecycle may suitable for your project. On another way, a water fall lifecycle may suitable for quick startup project.</p>

<p>Step out engineer scoop, the requirements are the first commercial context we are facing. Requirements comes from customers may chaos, redundant or too many to complete. The product manager should take the responsibility to define the product volumes because of the constrains. Constrains include monetary limitations, time limitations, human resource limitations and physical limitations, etc. Project boundary defining is a key step to ensure  your project success. Cost and profit are another two factors that commercial project should considered. For any project, there at lease three partners: investors who provide resource to run the project, product running organization who develop valuable things to customers, customers who pay money to enjoy the value provided by the product. The investors fund the product because they believe the project profitable. Product running organization development the product because they believe that customers require such a product, it will serve customers and they can earn money from the market. Customers use the product because they really need it and it provides value for customers. Customers always want perfect product with functions they required. More functions and perfect software means more investment, and more risks on software development. Product manager should consider the balance between investment and its produce, functions and project risks.</p>

<p>As we know, comparing with projects in other field such as construction, IT projects fail in higher rate. The main reason is  requirements modification from customers. The modification causes re-designing and re-implementation, extends the project duration and greatly increase project cost. Project fails when the cost exceeds budget. Sometime, time is also a budget, project duration extension running out planed date also means project failure.</p>

<p>There are two way to solve this issue: 1. product management. 2. Using model driven software development.</p>

<p>Firstly, project manager should adopt the requirements management to his/her management scope. Different with market people collecting and managing the requirements, project manager should extends his/her work to market partly, and specifically provide feedback to customers how their modification to requirement will impact current project schedule and cost.</p>

<p>Secondly, the feature that modification on model will immediately affect code makes model driven software development very suitable for resource limited dynamic requirements project. This kinds of project can benefit a lot even if applying model driven system development to parts of the IT system.</p>
